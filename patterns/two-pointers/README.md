# Two Pointers Pattern

The two pointers pattern involves using two reference points in an array or linked list to solve a problem efficiently.

## When to Use Two Pointers
- Finding pairs in a sorted array
- Comparing values from both ends of an array
- Finding subarrays that meet certain conditions
- Detecting cycles in linked lists

## Common Problem Types
1. Opposite directional pointers
2. Same directional pointers
3. Fast and slow pointers

## Example Problems
Check the `problems/` directory for practice problems categorized by difficulty.

## Solutions
Find solutions in multiple programming languages in the `solutions/` directory.
